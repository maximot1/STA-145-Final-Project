# STA-145-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-145 final project. I looked at hitters on the New York Yankees over the last 2 decades and gathered data such as height/weight, games played, batting average, etc. Specifically, I analyzed strikeout rate and player nationality(whether they were born in the U.S.A. or elsewhere) in order to figure out if there was a relationship between the two variables. 

## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "maximot1-final_project.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file. 

## **Data**
The data collected for this project was hitters on the New York Yankees over the last 2 decades. The main goal of the analysis was to determine whether or not a hitter being born outside of the U.S.A. had an effect on their strikeout rate.
